---- VERSE ----
Ash in the sky, and the rivers all dry
The soil cracked where dreams would lie
But through the smoke, I saw a spark
A whisper growing in the dark

I felt the pull beneath my leaves
The earth was crying through the seeds
One by one, I plant the light
And bloom again what lost its fight


---- BUILD UP ----
Every stem that broke, I mend
Every end can bloom again
With roots so deep, I hear the call
A world reborn — I’ll give it all!

---- CHORUS ----
I'll fly! And never stop!
Through poisoned winds and crumbling rock
Lift the leaves, break the chain
Let the wild grow back again
I'll fly! And never fall!
Till the world can hear nature’s call
This is the last seed I sow—
And I won’t let go
